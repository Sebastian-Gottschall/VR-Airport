# VR-Airport

This Project is just a playground for me to use the learned stuff from the udacity courses.

## Installation

Actually the Project do not have a APK file for the phone. So just download it and open it in Unity.
In this repository is everything installed right now, so it should work after download

## Problems

- i had some troubles using Unity 5.5.0f3 with the newest GoogleSDK 1.10x. If this happen, use unity 5.4.x with the same google sdk version - this helped for me.
- use this link to configure the sdk https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/guide. 
- be sure u use the following prefabs and scripts as described: GvrPointerGraphicRaycaster, GvrReticlePointer, GvrPointerInputModule, GvrPointerManager
